# Registration-guided 3D-UNets for AC-PC Landmark Prediction on CT
This repository provides code to develop and evaluate a framework of image registration informed 3D-UNets to automatically predict the Anterior (AC) and Posterior Commissure (PC) landmarks on non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scans. 

## Model Availability Disclaimer
As this framework was developed using data from the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA), we are unable to publicly release the model weights trained on internal VA head CT scans due to patient privacy regulations and data security policies. However, we provide the complete source code and a detailed step-by-step tutorial to enable researchers to train the model using their own datasets.

## Illustration of AC-PC landmark prediction on a sample CT scan 
Below is a schematic representation of the predicted AC-PC landmarks compared to the reference-standard landmarks on a sample CT slice from the... The landmarks are also illustrated on an MRI template for reference.
